SVM-Classification-Predictor
This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the Pass/Fail outcome of candidates based on their performance in written tests, group discussions, and interviews. The dataset includes features such as test scores, discussion participation, and interview feedback, with the final outcome as the target variable.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling categorical data, outlier detection, and feature standardization.
SVM Model: Implemented using the SVC(kernel='poly', class_weight='balanced') to classify outcomes.
3D Data Visualization: Created with Plotly to visualize feature separability and the effectiveness of the model.

Results:
Achieved an accuracy of 83.33% in predicting candidate outcomes, demonstrating the power of SVM in classification tasks.
